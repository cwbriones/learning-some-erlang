Test case: construction a tree from {a, 1}, {b, 2}, {c, 3}

in the naive tree you would end up with
 {a,1}
    \
   {b,2}
      \
     {c,3}
in the balanced tree you would end up with
  {b,2}
  /    \
{a,1} {c,3}

STEP 1

Upon insertion:
Node is {a, 1} and is black.

STEP 2

Upon insertion:
Root Node is black {a, 1} 
    right: red {b, 2}.
Nothing happens.

STEP 3

Upon insertion:
Root Node is black {a, 1} 
    right: red {b, 2}.
        right: red {c, 3}
Violation: right is doubled right. pattern matches.
NewData -> {b, 2}, NewLeft -> {a, 1}, NewRight -> {c, 1}, black
